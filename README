Nuke is a utility to aggregate snoggin data that is older than a particular date, reducing the size of the database.

Snoggin metrics are stored in 10 second intervals. For each day past the cutoff, this tool will insert an average of that day's data, and remove the 10 second data.

Usage
=====

java -jar nuke.jar [mongo host] [mongo port] [mongo user] [mongo password] [number of days to keep]

(If your database has no username or password, use "")

Building
========

run `sbt assembly`

This will produce target/nuke-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar, which can be renamed to nuke.jar for clarity.
